# 🚗 Number Plate Digit Recognizer (Nepali Vehicle Plates)

A Machine Learning–based system for recognizing **Nepali vehicle number plate digits and characters** from images.  
The application identifies digits **0–9** and Nepali characters **बा** and **प**.  
If an uploaded image does not belong to the trained dataset, the system returns **Unknown / Out of Dataset**.

This project demonstrates practical implementation of **Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and REST API development** using Python.

## 📌 Problem Statement

Manual identification of vehicle number plates is time-consuming and error-prone, especially in traffic monitoring and security systems.  
Nepali number plates include unique characters that are not supported by many existing recognition systems.
